is there anyway in javascript to override the string comparison operation for I
soPriceWords so that it does a numeric sort after omission of the currency? rathe
r than string sort? i.e., USD 100 should be > than USD 9

---

we want it safe to use by default

and that seems like a footgun we could eliminate


---


otherwise,

sortPrices & isPriceGreaterThan & comparePrices

if that's the only option

----

❯ how about isIsoPrice.greater, .lesser, .equal ? also, sortPrices


❯ sortPrices should do prices sort ;  but yes, sortPrices.asc and sortPrices.desc and sortPrices defaults to sortPrices.asc
  ; also, asIsoPrice.sorted ?
