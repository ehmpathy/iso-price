lets update the name of this package to `iso-price` and adopt iso standard price conventions

specifically

leverage IsoCurrency declaration for currency explicitly

leverage IsoRates declaration for iso rates

leverage all the other price relevant Iso standards that exist and create a comprehensive glossary of price domain objects and operations

---

we want to do a full rename of the package ; sedreplace iso-price with iso price


we want to rename the Price dobj to IsoPrice

everything should be consitent that this comes from the IsoPrice repo


---

we want ubiquitous, intuitive, and approachable operations for all common operations required related to prices


---

further, we want to ensure that

IsoPriceWords

and

IsoPriceShape

are distinct interfaces

and IsoPrice composes both of them


that way, if someone declares an input of IsoPrice, they can supply either IsoPriceWords or IsoPriceShape

just like IsoDuration from the github.com/ehmpathy/iso-time package

(we'll want the same test coverage on IsoPrice as was delivered for IsoDuration)


---

same with the casts

asIsoPriceShape
asIsoPriceWords
isIsoPriceShape
isIsoPriceWords
asIsoPrice -> casts to shape, since that's the most reusable
isIsoPrice -> accepts either
